### Darric Heng

I am fascinated by how things work under the hood; I explore and read widely to remove as much of the magic as I can from the software we use daily.

**General info**

- 👨‍💻 My current main project is a [personal finance app](https://github.com/darricheng/finance-app)
- 🛠 I'm trying to sharpen my skills with Rust and Go
- ✍️ I write occasionally at [my website](https://darricheng.com)

**Me and software**

- 🖥 Terminal > IDEs & GUIs
- ⌨ I think Neovim (and Vim in general) is awesome!
- 🌳 Data Manipulation > User Interfaces
