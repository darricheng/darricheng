### Darric Heng

I am fascinated by how things work under the hood; I explore and read widely to remove as much of the magic as I can from the software I use.

**General info**

- 👨‍💻 Professionally, I work mainly with TypeScript
- 🛠 I'm sharpening my skills with Rust and Go
- ✍️ I write at [my website](https://darricheng.com)
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/darric-heng)

**Me and software**

- 🖥 Probably hanging out in tmux
- ⌨ I think Neovim (and Vim in general) is AWESOME!
- 🤔 How does this work under the hood?
- ❓ I strive to be language-agnostic, focusing on learning key CS and software concepts instead
